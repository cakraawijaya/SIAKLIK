# SIAKLIK
We worked on this PKL from 2020 to 2021. The results of the PKL are in the form of a Clinical Service System Website. This was made as an effort to fulfill the requirements for an undergraduate degree. This project is closely related to the UPN Veteran East Java Health Clinic, where the website developed takes into account the phenomena in the field. To find out the extent of the quality of this website, a validation test is carried out, this uses the Blackbox Testing method.
